Simple Python Bruteforcer
=========================

A very simple and basic web form bruteforcer coded in python.

It is only ideal when you know that the password length is 6 or less and when the login page doesn't use any CAPTCHA protection, otherwise I don't reccomend it. 

Also, it is required to change some parameters in the code in order to work for your scenario.
An example login page is include it to test it locally if you wish.
